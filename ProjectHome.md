The objective of the project is to build a working Tetris game that can be played
free of bugs with alterations to the classic game to make it more user-friendly, fun, and
challenging. The game is meant to be open source and will be created under the MIT license and guidelines. The game will be playable as a single player
game. Players will be able to enjoy various game modes allowing them to play the
classic Tetris or new modes that put a new “spin” on the classic game. The game play
changes for the new modes may include items that help or harm the player, importable
music selection, different block shapes, a selection of skins, a marathon mode and timetrial
mode.
